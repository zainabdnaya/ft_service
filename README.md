  ###### what is Docher ?! :thought_balloon:
  ###### Docker is software that allows users to run lightweight virtual machines. You can build Docker "containers" with a Dockerfile. A container is a single lightweight virtual machine running an os, with its own memory space and storage. It is created on an image, which is a template with preconfigured software. A container differs from a virtual machine because it uses the same kernel as the host computer, whereas a virtual machine has its own kernel. Containers are faster and lighter
